# despace
Just another spacecraft components & analytics database which you're able to take anywhere even without an internet connection.

The proposed starting point **[is here](index.md)** or you may look at the [FAQ](faq.md).

You may use your favorite markdown‑editor/viewer to use this database on your PC or mobile device. Currently the proposed editor is [VNote ⎆](https://github.com/tamlok/vnote) with a [custom theme ❐](js/v_nk.zip).
